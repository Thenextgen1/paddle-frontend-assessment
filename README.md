```JavaScript
localhost:3000/desiredpage
```

* Task 2 - To view the github task:

Navigate to the /github route as well.

## Dependencies Used

The following dependencies were required and used for the assessment:

* Millify - Converted long numbers to readable strings obtained from calling the REST api in the /github route
* Moment - Exracted and Parsed the date each repository was created, in the /github route, relative to the date set in the REST api.
* React-Icons - Obtained specific icons from a collection of libraries.
* React-Infinite-Scroll-Component - Used to implement infinite scroll in the /github route.
* React-Reveal - Implemented certain animations in the coming soon and contact components.

## What can be improved about this application

* For the blog page, a custom api which returns JSON data or CMS should be created to host the contents of the blog.
* The coming soon component could use a real time animated counter.
* For UI best practices a light and darkmode design of each page should be created with a custom button or switch to change styles to the desired mode. or render styles based on the specification by the OS.
